SMS 2 – Database & Security Adoption
====================================

1. Start Apache + MySQL (XAMPP)
2. Copy the project folder into htdocs. Any folder name is OK.
3. Install schema (once), from the project folder:
     C:\xampp\php\php.exe database\install.php
4. Open setup and create YOUR Super Admin (no demo accounts):
     http://localhost/<your-folder-name>/setup/
5. After setup, add staff/student users in User Management.

If the other computer has a MySQL password or different database names, copy:
     config\local.example.php
to:
     config\local.php
then edit the values there.

What install creates:
  - roles, role_permissions, system_settings, empty users table

What install does NOT create:
  - demo logins / sample users
